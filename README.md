# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in Particle Physics
This GitHub repository contains the code that was used in an attempt to use GANs in the field of Particle Physics at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). This project was an attempt to use GANs to simulate top-antitop quark production in proton-proton collisions in the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) at CERN. <br />

## About the code
### Prerequisites
* The code was written in Python. You will need the various Python packages imported in the code to run it
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) API was used
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning framework was used
* [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) scientific software framework was used to make plots <br />

### Executing Program
1. Run ttbar_getdata_script.py <br />
2. Run ttbar_gan.py <br />
3. Run ttbar_plotting_script.py <br />
NOTE: All the code was run on NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPUs
